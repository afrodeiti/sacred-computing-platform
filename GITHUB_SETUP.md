# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Follow these steps to upload the Sacred Computing Platform to GitHub and set it up for deployment.

## Creating a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "sacred-computing-platform")
4. Add a description: "A sacred geometry visualization platform with real-time energetic feedback via WebSockets and persistent soul archive storage"
5. Set the repository to Public or Private based on your preference
6. Check "Add a README file" (we'll replace it with our own)
7. Add a .gitignore for Python
8. Choose a license (MIT is recommended)
9. Click "Create repository"

## Uploading Your Code to GitHub

### Option 1: Using the Command Line

```bash
# Initialize git in your project directory (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit - Sacred Computing Platform"

# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/sacred-computing-platform.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Using GitHub Desktop

1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Add the project folder to GitHub Desktop
4. Write a summary for your commit (e.g., "Initial commit - Sacred Computing Platform")
5. Click "Publish repository"
6. Fill in the repository details and click "Publish"

## Setting Up GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to showcase your project with a simple website:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Scroll down to "GitHub Pages"
4. Under "Source", select "main" branch and "/docs" folder
5. Click "Save"
6. Create a simple docs folder with an index.html file in your repository

## Setting Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

You can set up GitHub Actions to automatically test your code:

1. In your repository, click on the "Actions" tab
2. Choose a Python workflow template
3. Customize the workflow to run your tests
4. Commit the workflow file to your repository

## Protecting Your API Key

Never commit API keys to GitHub. Instead:

1. Use environment variables in your code
2. For local development, use a .env file (which is in the .gitignore)
3. For production, set environment variables in your deployment platform (e.g., Render)

## Collaborating with Others

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Click on "Manage access"
3. Click "Invite a collaborator"
4. Enter the GitHub username or email of your collaborator
5. Choose their permission level
6. Click "Add"

## Next Steps

After your code is on GitHub:

1. Set up the Render deployment using the provided render.yaml file
2. Configure the OpenAI GPT Action to use your deployed API
3. Share your custom GPT with others
4. Continue to improve your code and push updates to GitHub

Remember to keep your repository updated with any changes you make locally!
