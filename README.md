# Sacred Computing Platform

A comprehensive platform for sacred geometry visualization, intention broadcasting, and energetic healing through quantum-encoded network packets.

## Overview

The Sacred Computing Platform is an integrated system that allows users to:

- Broadcast intentions directly through WiFi network packets
- Generate and visualize sacred geometry patterns (Torus, Merkaba, etc.)
- Store and retrieve soul archives
- Access a library of healing codes
- Receive real-time energetic feedback via WebSockets

This platform combines ancient sacred geometry principles with modern quantum physics concepts to create a powerful tool for intention amplification and energetic healing.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Optional packages for enhanced functionality:
  - `matplotlib` and `numpy` for visualization features
  - `websockets` for real-time WebSocket communication

### Basic Installation

1. Download the consolidated file:
   ```
   sacred_computing_platform.py
   ```

2. Install optional dependencies (recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy websockets
   ```

## Usage

The Sacred Computing Platform can be used in three different modes:

### 1. Server Mode

Run a full web server with WebSocket support for the complete experience:

```bash
python sacred_computing_platform.py --mode server
```

This will start:
- A web server on port 8000 (customizable with `--http-port`)
- A WebSocket server on port 8765 (customizable with `--ws-port`)
- SQLite database for persistent storage

The server will automatically open a browser window to the application interface.

### 2. Broadcast Mode

Embed intentions into network packets for transmission:

```bash
python sacred_computing_platform.py --mode broadcast --intention "Healing and peace"
```

Options:
- `--frequency` - Set the frequency in Hz (default: 7.83, the Schumann resonance)
- `--field-type` - Choose the sacred geometry field (options: torus, merkaba, metatron, sri_yantra, flower_of_life)
- `--amplify` - Apply divine proportion amplification
- `--multiplier` - Set the Fibonacci multiplier for amplification
- `--output` - Save the packet data to a JSON file

### 3. Calculate Mode

Generate sacred geometry calculations without broadcasting:

```bash
python sacred_computing_platform.py --mode calculate --intention "Healing" --field-type torus
```

This mode supports the same options as broadcast mode but doesn't transmit packets.

## Sacred Geometry Patterns

The platform supports these sacred geometry patterns:

1. **Torus Field** - The fundamental energy pattern of the universe
2. **Merkaba** - Counter-rotating tetrahedrons representing spiritual protection
3. **Metatron's Cube** - Sacred geometric pattern containing all Platonic solids
4. **Sri Yantra** - Sacred symbol representing the cosmos and the human body
5. **Flower of Life** - Ancient pattern representing creation and connectedness

## Network Packet Structure

Intentions are embedded into custom network packets with this structure:

```
+----------------+------------------+---------------+
| Packet Header  | Intention Data   | Sacred Data   |
+----------------+------------------+---------------+
```

- **Packet Header**: Contains protocol version, packet type, checksum
- **Intention Data**: The intention text, frequency, and field type
- **Sacred Data**: Energy signature and quantum entanglement keys

## Healing Codes

The platform includes a database of healing codes for various conditions:

- Physical ailments (headaches, pain, etc.)
- Emotional healing (stress, anxiety, etc.)
- Spiritual development
- Relationship harmonization

Access them through the web interface or via API calls.

## Soul Archive

Your intentions, sacred geometry patterns, and energetic configurations can be saved to the Soul Archive for later retrieval.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Database Path

```bash
python sacred_computing_platform.py --mode server --db-path custom_path.db
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
python sacred_computing_platform.py --mode broadcast --intention "Test" --debug
```

### Custom Port Configuration

```bash
python sacred_computing_platform.py --mode server --http-port 3000 --ws-port 8080
```

## Visualizations

If you have matplotlib and numpy installed, the platform can generate visualizations of sacred geometry patterns. These are automatically displayed in the web interface or saved to files in calculate mode.

## Developer Notes

- The platform uses SHA-256 and SHA-512 for cryptographic hashing
- Energy signatures are generated using secure random number generators
- All calculations involving the golden ratio (PHI) use the exact value
- The Schumann resonance (7.83 Hz) is used as the default frequency
