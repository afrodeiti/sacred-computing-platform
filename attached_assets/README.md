# 12 Chakra QR Code Bundle

Welcome to the **12 Chakra QR Code Bundle**! This bundle includes a unique set of QR codes representing the 12 chakras, each carefully computed and designed to emit positive energy and help align your chakras.

## About the Bundle

This collection of QR codes has been crafted to represent the 12 main chakras in the human energy system:

1. Root Chakra (Muladhara)
2. Sacral Chakra (Svadhishthana)
3. Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura)
4. Heart Chakra (Anahata)
5. Throat Chakra (Vishuddha)
6. Third Eye Chakra (Ajna)
7. Crown Chakra (Sahasrara)
8. Earth Star Chakra
9. Soul Star Chakra
10. Higher Heart Chakra
11. Causal Chakra
12. Stellar Gateway Chakra

Each QR code has been generated with hash codes that I meticulously computed over several hours to ensure they provide the best energetic experience for you.
You will notice that the color of each QR Code represents the color of that chakra.
